====== Ant ======

We build and deploy the project mainly with [[http://ant.apache.org|Ant]]. Here we will provide some documentation on that topic.

===== Important Targets =====

==== compile ====

==== deploy-wiki ====
deploys everything under doc/wiki to vimplugin.org. Some of the files are generated by other targets:

see [[#todo]]

==== todo ====
autogenerates a todo list for the wiki similar to the taskview of eclipse.

===== autogenerating wiki pages =====

Since this [[doku>wiki:dokuwiki|wiki-implementation]] uses plain textfiles for data-storage, it is easy to auto-generate content from the ant-buildfile. 

See the page [[todo]] as an example. It is produced by the  target "todos" ...

===== Platform Dependencies =====

//currently only tested under Linux //

Issues:
  * scp task is optional task
  * javadoc target uses hardcoded file-system locations.
