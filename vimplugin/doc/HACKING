If you want to get your hands dirty, this is the right place for you. 

For the beginning we provide instructions only for linux users. In theory vimplugin 
will work on other platforms, but thats not tested well by now.

The easiest is to use a standard eclipse installation (e.g. debian or ubuntu)

1.) check out the sources from sourceforge:
protocol: pserver
user: anonymous
host: vimplugin.cvs.sourceforge.net
path: /cvsroot/vimplugin

module: vimplugin

2.) building
If all dependencies are met (this should be the standard case), just use "Run as Eclipse 
Application" (e.g. from the contect menu of the project).

Create a project and a test file. Files with ending txt can be "Open with" "Vim".

3.) hacking
If you add some features for your own, or fix something to get it run, please create a 
patch and submit it to the developer-list. This is easy with eclipse:

a) In the context menu of the project there is the wizard Team->Create Patch.
b) Save patch in filesystem, using unified diff format, project as root of the patch.
c) mail the file to vimplugin-devel@lists.sourceforge.net
