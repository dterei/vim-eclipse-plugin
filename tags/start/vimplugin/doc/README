Description:

Vimplugin is an Eclipse plugin that allows to use vim as the
main editor component inside Eclipse. 

The editor of Eclipse itself is very powerful, but
programmers coming from vim will miss many features they are
used to.

Vimplugin uses JTA, the Java Telnet Application, which
includes a SwingTerminal that can be used to run (a
textbased) vim in a Swing-application.


Requirements:
	Sun Java >= 1.5
	JTA >= 2.5
	Vim

We need Sun Java because the SWT_AWT bridge uses propietary
classes from Sun. This requirement will change, once the SwingTerminal has
been ported to SWT.


Installation:
Unzip "vimplugin.zip" into your eclipse-directory.


Usage:
Under Window|Preferences|General|Editors|FileAssociations
you can assign different editor components to file types.

Right-click on the corresponding files and selecting "Open
with" will allow to use Vim to open the file.
